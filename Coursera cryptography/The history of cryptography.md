# Substitution cipher
> How to break it?

1. Use frequency of English
	1. *e*: 12.7%
	2. *t*: 9.1%
	3. *a*: 8.1%
2. Use frequency of pairs of letter (diagrams)
	1. "he"
	2. "ar"
	3. "in"
	4. "th"
**Ciphered text (CT) only attack**

$+ ( mod  26)$
m = `WHATANICEDAYTODAY`

c = `ZZZJUCLUDTUNWGCQS`
>How to break it?
1. Assume the key length
2. Divide ciphered text into parts/groups that are key length
3. First letter in each groups (encrypted with the same letter)
suppose most common = *H* $\Rightarrow$ first letter of key = *H* - *E* = *C*
